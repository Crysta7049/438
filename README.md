For this Low Level 3D Graphics Demo I used three.js to create simple interactive 3D model that somewhat represents an orbiting planet. I started off a little shaky I wasn't able to get a simple sphere to display on the scene for 6 hours until I realized I had my camera pointing in the wrong direction. After that I added a second primitive object(just another sphere, since I was excited about it showing up). I made it orbit around the original object using quaternion principles. Then to create some interacivity I then created a point light as a third sphere so that I could keep track of user mouse inputs and have the light source move along the surface of the biggest sphere or "earth". The visual for the moving light source still needs some tweaking it has trouble reaching the very top of the sphere. The only external file I used was the master file for three.js.
